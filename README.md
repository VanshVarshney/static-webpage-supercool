A static web page is a web page that is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application.
Static Web pages are very simple. It is written in languages such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. For static web pages when a server receives a request for a web page, then the server sends the response to the client without doing any additional process. And these web pages are seen through a web browser. In static web pages, Pages will remain the same until someone changes it manually.
In a sense, a static Web page is just a simple purveyor of information. Designers often use a combination of text and images, controlled by HTML tags, to render something that is a lot like a newspaper page. It has typesetting and layout, but it does not change from one load to another.
